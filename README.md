# Predicting Average Temperature of European Cities

#### Applied prediction models: Linear Regression, Autoregression, SARIMAX

The goal is to predict the temperature development of a city solely based on its historical temperature data. The dataset contains time and average temperature data of major global cities.

For this exercise, I compare the accuracy of different predictive models applied to the time series (Linear Regression, Autoregression, SARIMAX).  

Check out this [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/xaverdorner/climate_forecasting/blob/master/Week5_Climate_Forecasting.ipynb) to see the complete analysis.
